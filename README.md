Open source simulator for maritime robotics researchers

![uuv mapping](./uuv_mapping.png)

Plankton is an initiative aiming at simplifying robotics research in the maritime domain. 
It is a maritime environment simulator with an open source core, and a special focus on ease of use, stability, speed and sim to real. Its middleware of choice is ROS 2.

We intend to build a sustainable and open source core simulator for maritime robotics research. This core will support flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions.

This project benefits from great open source advances in the simulation domain, mainly ROS, gazebo and its plugin uuvsimulator.

# Roadmap #
The first iteration of the projet is build from uuvsimulator and gazebo 9. We made uuvsimulator compatible with ROS2, and improved the performance (speed) of the simulator. After this first iteration, we will test different alternatives to gazebo 9, and choose the best simulation framework according to our users present and future needs.

We plan to release a beta version of uuvsimulator for ROS 2 in August, and a v1 in October.

# Contributing #
You can contribute by reporting bugs, proposing new features, improving documentation, contributing to code.
### Reporting bugs ###
Use our issue section on GitHub. Please check before that the issue is not already reported.
### Proposing new features ###
Please check first the list of feature requests. If it is not there and you think is a feature that might be interesting for users, please submit your request as a new issue.
### Improving documentation ###
If you feel something is missing in the documentation, please don't hesitate to open an issue to let us know. Even better, if you think you can improve it yourself, it would be a great contribution to the community!
### Contributing to code ###
So you are considering making a code contribution, great! We love to have contributions from the community.
Before starting hands-on on coding, please check out our issue board to see if we are already working on that, it would be a pity putting an effort into something just to discover that someone else was already working on that. In case of doubt or to discuss how to proceed, please contact one of us (or send an email to info@liquid-tech.ai).
