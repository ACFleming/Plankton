Plankton is an initiative aiming at simplifying robotics research in the maritime domain. 
It is a maritime environment simulator with an open source core, and a special focus on ease of use, stability, speed and sim to real. Its middleware of choice is ROS 2.

This project benefits from great open source advances in the simulation domain, mainly ROS, gazebo and its plugin uuvsimulator
